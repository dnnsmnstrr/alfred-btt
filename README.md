# Alfred BetterTouchTool Workflow

An Alfred workflow to run named triggers and actions in BetterTouchTool

Description: `Run named triggers and actions in BetterTouchTool`

### About
```
This workflow uses the scripting interface of BetterTouchTool to allow searching and running named triggers or actions within BTT.

To get the list of named triggers, it uses the get_triggers function, which is available starting at version 4.034 of BTT.
```

### Tips

- Use spaces in the title of your named triggers, to make searching them easier
- Include the context of the trigger in the name (e.g. `spotify next`) for specific actions
